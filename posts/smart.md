## About SMART ##
[Sonoma Marin Area Rail Tranist](https://www.sonomamarintrain.org/) is the North Bay’s passenger rail service providing a safe, reliable and congestion-free transportation option for Marin and Sonoma counties. The current 45-mile system includes stations in Windsor, the Sonoma County Airport area, Santa Rosa, Rohnert Park, Cotati, Petaluma, Novato, San Rafael, and Larkspur. SMART’s system also includes a [bicycle and pedestrian pathway](https://www.sonomamarintrain.org/smart_pathway) along the rail corridor.

Future extensions are planned for Healdsburg and Cloverdale. The full project will provide 70 miles of passenger rail service, connecting SMART passengers with jobs, education centers, retail hubs and housing along the Sonoma-Marin corridor, and a bicycle-pedestrian pathway.
